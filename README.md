# 🌐 Roblox-External-Script-Execution
A simple app created in TypeScript (and Python for the gui) that executes Roblox scripts on the server

# 📜 Installation
To install the npm modules, you need to do `npm i`

`pip install customtkinter` for the Python gui

To run this, I recommend using ts-node. `cd src` and then `npx ts-node .`

For this to work in-game, you need to host it.
